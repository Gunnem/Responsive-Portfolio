		   I have a background in architecture, but I am currently an industrial designer. 
		   I mainly design tech related devices, such as desktop PCs and peripheral devices. 
		   I strive to create unique, timeless works that function as well as they look. 
		   Drawing inspiration from aerospace and race car engineering, my designs incorporate exotic 
		   materials and construction techniques commonly found in aerospace and racing applications. 
		   And because of my background in architeture, I also draw on the aesthetics and design 
		   principles found in modern architecture. 
		   I've always felt like my hardware designs could be complimented 
		   with something that could be akin to a soul. If hardware were a shell or body, one might consider 
		   software to be the soul. This is the reason why I decided to code -- to make my works come alive through
		   the soul that is coding.
